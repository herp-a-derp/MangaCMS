# This is a class used for situations where a script needs access to the database, but I don't
# want to have to write a whole new subclass of the MonitorDbBase.
# Basically, it's a way to abuse the plugin to let me do raw crap with the DB
# It's terrible practice, but laaaazy, and sometimes I do just
# need to hack a one-time-use thing together.
